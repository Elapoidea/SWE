- embedded
  - not great idea?
  - arduino simulated online (tinkercad?)


# Good ideas
- "second opinion" chat with doctors
  - "twitter if the verified people were doctors and everyone else is replies"

- from the "health monitoring and improvement" angle: an app/site that records general health/wellness/fitness/etc, and can summarize for your doctor
  - chatjippty API for "summarize this data in english, in short OR long format"
  - also, LLM that takes user data like "my tummy hurt when eat shrimp" and converts it to JSON-y data
  - 

- Make an API that gets health insurance plans and compares them
